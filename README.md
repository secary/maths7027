# MATHS 7027, Tri2, 2024
## [Mathematical Foundations of Data Science](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/course-outlines/110010/1/tri-2/)
This course introduces fundamental mathematical concepts relevant to computer science and provides a basis for further postgraduate study in data science, statistical machine learning, and cybersecurity. Topics covered are include: probability: sets, counting, probability axioms, Bayes theorem; optimisation and calculus: differentiation, integration, functions of several variables, series approximations; linear algebra: vector and matrices, matrix algebra, vector spaces; discrete mathematics and statistics: linear regression, linear least squares, regularisation. Applications of the theory to data science and machine learning will be developed.
