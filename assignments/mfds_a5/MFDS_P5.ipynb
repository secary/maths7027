    "One final remark before we finish this practical: We've used an example from network science/analysis to explore a little more about linear algebra in Python. Network science is just one area of data science (it's actually one of my favourite areas, and where some of my research is focused) - you can find many useful tools and packages (like `networkx`) to do network analysis in Python if you are interested. Even so, a lot of the more interesting and advanced methods you might find in those packages still rely on linear algebra, and we know that a good data scientist should understand *how* their tools work (rather than just how to make them work), so it's good to see linear algebra in action here."
